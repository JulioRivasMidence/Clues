How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

  /**
  I get a solution fewer than 20 every single time. It does not depend on strategy. It is consistently less than 20 on all theories.
  */

What is good or bad about this strategy?

  /**
    It is a good strategy because it doesn't randomly guess numbers. My strategy instead keeps track of the ones it has already guessed
    and guesses the next one according to the ones it has already guessed so it doesnt guess the same one more than one time.

    The only downside to my strategy is that is logic heavy so its hard for another person to clearly understand the code without explaining them whats going on
    also it increases the amount of memory the program utilizes.
